        "Question:\nNatalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nSteps:\nNatalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many in May, so she sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May.\nAltogether, Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips in April and May.\nSo the answer is 72.",
        "Question:\nWeng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nSteps:\nWeng earns $12 an hour for babysitting, so she earns $12/60 = $0.2 per minute.\nWeng did 50 minutes of babysitting, so she earned $0.2*50 = $10.\nSo the answer is 10.",
        "Question:\nBetty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nSteps:\nIn the beginning, Betty has only half of the money she needs, so she has $100/2 = $50.\nBetty's parents gave her $15, so she has $50+15 = $65.\nBetty's grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so her grandparents gave her $15*2 = $30.\nAltogether, Betty has $65+$30 = $95.\nBetty needs $100-$95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.\nSo the answer is 5.",
        "Question:\nJulie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nSteps:\nJulie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12*2 = 24 pages today.\nSince yesterday, Julie read 12+24 = 36 pages.\nSo there are 120-36 = 84 pages left to be read.\nSince she wants to read half of the remaining pages, she should read 84/2 = 42 pages.\nSo the answer is 42.",

        "Question:\nMark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nSteps:\nThere are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so there are 10*1.8 = 18 purple flowers.\nBecause there are 10 yellow flowers, so in total there are 10+18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers.\nThere are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so there are 28*0.25 = 7 green flowers.\nIn summary, Mark has 10+18+7 = 35 flowers in his garden.\nSo the answer is 35.",

If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?\nSteps:\nHe buys 2 large pizzas which have 16 slices each, so he has 2*16 = 32 slices.\nHe buys 2 small pizzas which have 8 slices each, so he has 2*8 = 16 slices.\nThere are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32+16 = 48 pieces that day.\nSo the answer is 48.",
        "Question:\nKen created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nSteps:\nKen poured jelly beans into the box until the weight was 2 pounds, so the weight of the box was 2 pounds at first.\nThen Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, so the weight of the box was 2*3 = 6 pounds.\nAfter Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, the weight of the box was 6+2 = 8 pounds.\nFinally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, so the weight of the box was 8*2 = 16 pounds.\nSo the answer is 16.",
        "Question:\nAlexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\nSteps:\nLet's calculate how much Alexis spent one by one.\nAlexis spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, so now she spent 30+46 = $76.\nAlexis spent $38 on a suit coat, so now she spent 76+38 = $114.\nAlexis spent $11 on socks, so now she spent 114+11 = $125.\nAlexis spent $18 on a belt, so now she spent 125+18 = $143.\nAlexis had a budget of $200 and finally there was $16 left, so she spent 200-16 = $184 in total.\nSince Alexis has spent $143 on everything else, she spent 184-143 = $41 on the shoes.\nSo the answer is 41.",
        "Question:\nTina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nSteps:\nTina makes $18 an hour, so she makes 18*8 = $144 in an 8-hour shift.\nTina works 10 hours every day for 5 days, so she works 10*5 = 50 hours.\nSince she works 8 hours every day, she gets 50-8*5 = 10 hours of overtime.\nHer hourly overtime wage is 18+18/2 = $27.\nTina works 10 hours a day, and 8 hours of that is paid at her regular hourly wage, so she makes 10-8 = 2 hours of overtime every day.\nSince her hourly overtime wage is $27, she makes 27*2 = $54 in overtime each day.\nEvery day, tina makes $144 in an 8-hour shift and $54 in overtime, so she makes 144+54 = $198 each day.\nTina works 5 days a week, so she makes 198*5 = $990.\nSo the answer is 990.\n"

    "self-eval": "You are answering some mathematical questions by reasoning step by step. Evaluate whether the given intermediate step is useful for answering the question.\n\nQuestion:\nFour years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?\nSteps:\nMohamed is twice as 30 years old, so Mohamed is 30*2 = 60 years old.\nFour years ago, Mohamed was 60-4 = 56 years old.\nFour years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed, so Kody was 56/2 = 28 years old.\nIs this step useful?\nYes, this step is useful because it directly calculates Kody's age four years ago, which is necessary to determine his current age.\n\nQuestion:\nTraci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?\nSteps:\nTraci brings 9 cakes from her own house.\nIs this step useful?\nNo, this step is not useful because it does not provide information about the amount of flour Traci brought, which is needed to calculate the total flour used.\n\nQuestion:\nA quantity surveyor is figuring the construction costs for a couple that wishes to build a house. The costs are as follows: land costs $50 per square meter, bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks and roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile. If the house they wish to build requires 2000 square meters, 10000 bricks, and 500 roof tiles, how much construction costs are required for this project?\nSteps:\nThe land costs $50 per square meter, so the land costs 50*2000 = $100000.\nThe bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks, so the bricks cost 100*10000 = $1000000.\nThe roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile, so the roof tiles cost 10*500 = $5000.\nIs this step useful?\nYes, this step is useful because it directly calculates the total construction costs, which is necessary to answer the question.\n\nQuestion:\nWallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. If the capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons and it's 3/4 full, calculate the total number of gallons of water they both have if Catherine's water heater is also full with water to 3/4 of its capacity.\nSteps:\nWallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater, so Wallace's water heater is 40*2 = 80 gallons.\nWallace and Catherine both have 3/4 of their water heaters full, in total they have 80*3/4 + 40*3/4 = 60 gallons of water.\nIs this step useful?\nNo, this step is not useful because it combines several steps into one, which is not ideal for clear step-by-step reasoning."
