        "Question:\nA class of 35 students has an average height of 180 cm. Seven students whose average height is 120 cm, left the class and seven others whose average height is 140 cm, joined. Calculate the new average height of the students of the class (in cm) is?\nOptions:\nA)204.6 cm, B)404.6 cm, C)224.6 cm, D)184.0 cm, E)256.6 cm.\nAnswer:\nThe total height of students before seven students left is 180 * 35 = 6300 cm.\nThe total height of students who left is 120 * 7  = 840 cm.\nThe total height of students who joined is 140 * 7  = 980 cm.\nThe new total height of students after the seven students left and seven students joined is 6300 - 840 + 980 = 6440 cm.\nThe new average height is 6440 / 35 = 184 cm.\nSo the answer is D.",

        "Question:\nIn a certain store, the profit is 320% of the cost. If the cost increases by 25% but the selling price remains constant, approximately what percentage of the selling price is the profit?\nOptions:\nA)80%, B)70%, C)60%, D)50%, E)40%.\nAnswer:\nLet cost be 100.\nThe profit is 320% of the cost, so the profit is 100 * 3.2 = 320.\nThe selling price is 100 + 320 = 420.\nThe cost increases by 25% but the selling price remains constant, so the new cost is 100 * 0.25 + 100 = 125.\nThe new profit is 420 - 125 = 295.\nThe percentage is 296/420 * 100% = 70%.\nSo the answer is B.",
        "Question:\nA 290 meters long train running at the speed of 120 kmph crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds. What is the length of the other train?\nOptions:\nA)230 m, B)210 m, C)260 m, D)320 m, E)330 m.\nAnswer:\nThe relative speed of the trains is 120 + 80 = 200 kmph.\nThe speed in m/s is 200 kmph = (200 * 1000)/3600m/s = 500/9 m/s.\nThe distance traveled in 9 seconds is 500/9 * 9 = 500 m.\nThe length of the other train is 500 - 290 = 210 m.\nSo the answer is B.",
        "Question:\nA train, 140 meters long, travels at a speed of 45 km/hr and crosses a bridge in 30 seconds. The length of the bridge is?\nOptions:\nA)270 m, B)245 m, C)235 m, D)220 m, E)240 m.\nAnswer:\nThe speed in m/s is 45 km/hr = (45 * 1000)/3600 m/s = 12.5 m/s.\nThe total distance traveled is 12.5 m/s * 30 s = 375 m.\nThe length of the bridge is 375 m - 140 m = 235 m.\nSo the answer is C.",
        "Question:\nA coin is tossed three times. What is the probability that there is at the least one tail?\nOptions:\nA)7/8, B)6/7, C)1/7, D)3/7, E)1/31.\nAnswer:\nThe probability of getting all heads is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\nThe probability of at least one tail is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.\nSo the answer is A.",
        "Question:\n10 men, working 3 hours a day can complete a work in 18 days. How many hours a day must 15 men work to complete the work in 12 days?\nOptions:\nA)3 hours a day, B)5 hours a day, C)6 hours a day, D)7 hours a day, E)8 hours a day.\nAnswer:\nThe total man-hours needed to complete the work is 10 * 3 * 18 = 540.\nThe number of hours for 15 men to complete the work is 540 / 15 = 36.\nThe number of hours to complete the work in 12 days is 36 / 12 = 3 hours a day.\nSo the answer is A.",
        "Question:\nWhen 20 percent of a number is added to another number the second number increases to 140 per cent. What is the ratio between the first and the second number?\nOptions:\nA)3 : 4, B)2 : 1, C)3 : 2, D)Data inadequate, E)None of these.\nAnswer:\nLet the first and the second numbers be x and y respectively.\nThen, we have the equation: 0.2x + y = 1.4y.\nSolving for y, we get 0.2x = 0.4y.\nTherefore, x/y = 0.4/0.2 = 2/1 = 2 : 1.\nSo the answer is B.",
        "Question:\nAn electric pump can fill a tank in 7 hours. Because of a leak in the tank, it took 14 hours to fill the tank. If the tank is full, how much time will the leak take to empty it?\nOptions:\nA)10 hours, B)12 hours, C)8 hours, D)5 hours, E)14 hours.\nAnswer:\nThe filling rate of the pump without leak is 1/7.\nThe filling rate of the pump with leak is 1/14.\nThe rate of the leak is 1/7 - 1/14 = 1/14.\nThe leak will empty the tank in 14 hours.\nSo the answer is E."

    "self-eval": "You are answering some mathematical questions by reasoning step by step. Evaluate whether the given intermediate step is useful for answering the question.\n\nQuestion:\nJohn found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nOptions:\nA)50, B)45, C)65, D)78, E)64.\nAnswer:\nThe sum of the 15 numbers is 15 * 40 = 600.\nIf 10 is added to each number, the sum also increases by 15 * 10 = 150.\nIs this step useful?\nYes, this step is useful because it calculates the total increase in the sum of the numbers when 10 is added to each, which is necessary to find the new mean.\n\nQuestion:\nIf a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nOptions:\nA)1/2, B)3/2, C)5/2, D)4/2, E)7/2.\nAnswer:\nExpress b in terms of a from the first equation, we get b = 4a/3.\nSubstituting b = 4a/3 into 8a + 5b = 22, we get: 8a + 5 * (4a/3) = 22, simplifying further: 44a/3 =22.\nExpress a in terms of b from the first equation, we get a = 3b/4.\nIs this step useful?\nNo, this step is not useful because the value of 'a' has already been correctly expressed in terms of 'b' in the previous steps, making this additional step redundant for solving the problem.\n\nQuestion:\nIf q is the square of a positive integer, which of the following must be equal to the square of the next positive integer?\nOptions:\nA)\u221an + 1, B)n + 1, C)n^2 + 1, D)q + 2\u221aq + 1, E)n^2 + 2n + 1.\nAnswer:\nAssume the positive integer to be 5.\nIs this step useful?\nNo, this step is not useful because the problem can be solved with a general algebraic approach rather than using a specific example, ensuring the solution is universally applicable.\n\nQuestion:\nA train, 140 meters long, travels at a speed of 45 km/hr and crosses a bridge in 30 seconds. The length of the bridge is?\nOptions:\nA)270 m, B)245 m, C)235 m, D)220 m, E)240 m\nAnswer:\nThe speed of the train in m/s is 45 *  1000/3600 = 25/2 m/s.\nThe total distance the train travels is 25/2 * 30 = 375 m.\nIs this step useful?\nYes, this step is useful because it calculates the total distance covered by the train in 30 seconds, which is essential to determine the length of the bridge when combined with the length of the train.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average of the first 21 multiples of 7?\nOptions:\nA)22, B)77, C)88, D)21, E)65\nAnswer:\nThe sum of the first 21 multiples of 7 is 7 * (1+2+\u2026.+21) = 1617.\nIs this step useful?\nNo, this step is not useful because it attempts a direct calculation of the sum, which can be complex and error-prone."
